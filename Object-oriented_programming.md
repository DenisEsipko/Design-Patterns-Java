# Object-oriented Programming

## OO Basics
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance

## S.O.L.I.D Principles

S.O.L.I.D stands for:
* S - Single-responsiblity principle
* O - Open-closed principle
* L - Liskov substitution principle
* I - Interface segregation principle
* D - Dependency Inversion Principle

### Single-responsiblity Principle

### Open-closed Principle

### Liskov Substitution Principle

### Interface Segregation Principle

### Dependency Inversion Principle

## Loose Coupling
* Always strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact with each other.
* Loosely coupled objects can interact with each other, but still have very little knowledge and dependancies on each other.
* Loosely coupled object-oriented design allows for flexible and reusable systems.
* Loosely coupled minimize the interdependancy between objects.
